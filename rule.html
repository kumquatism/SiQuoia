  Mention this (from SRS)...
  <blockquote>
At first glance, SiQuoia may look like an ordinary quiz program. 
On a generic scheme, SiQuoia is basically a multiple choice type of quiz 
program with each set consisting of one question followed by four answers 
with one and only one of them being correct.

In order to participate, users/gamers register with SeQuoia, paying a small 
registration fee. They could also register to play a sample game but only 
paid users/gamers can continue playing beyond the sample set. Each game 
session begins with login (or registration).

As players progress through levels, achievements are tracked and points 
awarded. Points accumulated can be later exchanged for rewards such as quiz 
packets and game memorabilia.

Gamers can submit questions (each with four relevant answers of which one and 
only one is correct) from within the game. Questions submitted will be 
verified, edited and categorized (Topic, subtopics) with in the system. 
Gamers earn points for questions submitted too. (Crowd Sourcing?)

Gamers also earn points for introducing new gamers that register and play 
beyond the sample game. Games are made available in question packets that can
 be purchased with either cash or reward points.

A game can include multimedia content.

Special game sets can be branded with corporate logos and be made available 
with codes. For example a DMV branded game that helps train for a driverâ€™s 
written test.

Game status for each gamer is stored (Cloud?) when a gamer leaves the system and restored when a gamer logins again.
The system also maintains and monitors a leaderboard and potentially has interfaces to social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.
